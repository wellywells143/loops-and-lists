# Instructions  

For this coding exercise, you will create a list and run a loop through it. Then, you will create a slice or subset of the list and also run a loop through the slice.

Your Spotify playlist is a type of list. Here is the learning outcomes for this exercise:
  1. Create and run a loop through a list
  2. Create a slice of the list
  3. Run a loop through the slice

## Steps
No.| To do
:-:|:-
1| In lines 9-25, a new list is created of the tracklist for Beyonce's new album, Renaissance. Line 28 prints this list.
2| In lines 30-33, it gives an overview of how to create a loop. Lines 34-35 creates a loop that prints each song individually in the output.
3| In lines 38-39, this loop prints f-strings of each song concatenated with a string message.
4| In lines 43-45, this loop shows the importance of indenting your code if you want it to be included in your loop.
5| In lines 47-48, it gives instructions for you to create your own list of your favorite tv-shows. 
6| Starting in line 49, create your own list.
7| After creating your own list of your favorite shows, create a FOR loop that prints an f-string of a message that includes each show in your list. Model your code after lines 38-39.
8| Then, create another FOR loop by modifying your loop similar to lines 43-45. Modify this new loop by adding this statement in a new code line (use \n): "How many streams do you think {show} will have this year?"
9| After creating these series of loops, you will find comments and codes on how to create slices. The first slice indicates a first and second index [1:4]; the second slice indicates only a second index [:4]; the third slice shows only a first index [2:]; and the last slice shows a negative index [-3:].
10| Then, there's comments and codes on how to run a loop through slice! This loops shows the first 3 songs in Beyonce's new album.
11| Finally, in the last line, create a slice from your own list and run a loop through your slice that prints each show with a string message.
12| After running your code and checking everything, go to the Version Control icon on the leftmost sidebar & send commit to Github.

  For example, here is a code block in python3
```python
def hello_world():
  print("hello world!")
```
